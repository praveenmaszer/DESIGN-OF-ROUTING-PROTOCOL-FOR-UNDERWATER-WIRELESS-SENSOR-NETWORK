# DESIGN-OF-ROUTING-PROTOCOL-FOR-UNDERWATER-WIRELESS-SENSOR-NETWORK
All routing protocol performs specific task in underwater wireless sensor network(UWSN). Routing is responsible for networking problems. The main design issues of the routing protocols for UWSN are Bandwidth capacity, problem related to low energy, node mobility and high propagation delays. In this project Dynamic route discovery, Cluster and depth based and Location based routing protocols are proposed. In Dynamic route discovery protocol the location of nodes, base stations and the battery powers are collected. Based on the location and the battery power route discovery process is done periodically. In order to improve the propagation delay, bandwidth and battery life time,cluster and depth based routing protocol is proposed. A cluster based network is formed to simplify the routing for forwarding the data packets. Route is discovered based on the depth of the previous sender and decides whether to forward a packet or not. Location based routing protocol is proposed to improve the delay and successful rate. A routing pipe is formed to buildconnection between source, destination and packet delivery. Estimation of neighborhood and to adjust the forwarding policy may be done using self-adoption algorithm. It may be simulated using Network Simulator(NS2) with 50 nodes and the routing efficiency may be analyzed using the parameters network throughput, packet delivery ratio and energy consumption.
